# Wmsy
A window manager in Python.

# What it does
* Binds the `Mod+Return` key for opening a terminal emulator of your choice (see `TERM = "urxvt"`)
* Binds the `Mod+F1` key for moving the focused window to the top of the stack.

* Binds `Mod+MB3` for resizing the window with the cursor. (`Mod + RightClick`)
